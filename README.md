Hola Amigos! I'm Arvind Murali — an Electronics grad with a big love for Analytics, Data Science, Embedded Systems, and IoT. I'm super curious about how data and electronics blend together to solve real-world problems. This repo is a collection of projects that reflect my learning journey so far, and I’m always up for building more cool stuff. Cheers!
