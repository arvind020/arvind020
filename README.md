Hola Amigos!
I am Arvind Murali and I am a passionate Analytics and Data Science enthusiast! I am also an enthusiastic learner in fields such as Embedded Systems and Internet of Things!
I hold a B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering and I am super proud of it!
I strongly feel both my areas of interests (i.e analytics and electronics) can be interlinked with each other, as any field of study in contemporary times deals with large amounts of data and it is highly essential to organize and process data efficiently for the smooth functioning of any organization.
I have collated my projects in this repository of mine, and i look forward to doing more such projects to upskill myself and grow my interests and expertise in these fields!
Cheers:)
