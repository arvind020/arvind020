Hello everybody!
I am Arvind Murali and I am a passionate Analytics and Data Science enthusiast!
I hold a B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering and I also love to delve into electronics fields such as Embedded Systems and Internet of Things. 
I strongly feel both my fields of interests (i.e analytics and electronics) can be interlinked with each other, as any field of study in contemporary times deal with large amounts of data and it is highly essential to organize and process data efficiently for the smooth functioning of the organization.
I have collated my projects in this repository of mine, and i look forward to doing more such projects to upskill myself and further my interests in these fields!
Cheers:)
